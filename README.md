# Installation
## Windows Auto Installation/Updating Using The AmongUsModUpdater
This tool was made by [Narua](https://github.com/Narua2010) and [Jolle](https://github.com/joelweih). It automatically installs/updates the TheOtherRoles mod to the newest version, runs the game and
syncs your game options automatically.

1. Simply get the newest [release](https://github.com/Narua2010/AmongUsModUpdater/releases/latest) of the [AmongUsModUpdater](https://github.com/Narua2010/AmongUsModUpdater)
2. Unzip the folder and run the **setup.exe**

If you have problems with the AmongUsModUpdater, make sure to [contact us](https://discord.gg/csa3pHYdPU).

## Windows Manual Installation
1. Download and unzip the newest [release](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest)
2. Find the folder of your game, for Steam players you can right click in Steam, on the game, a menu will appear proposing you to go to the folders.
3. Make a copy of your game, it's not obligatory but advised, put it where you want.
4. Drag or extract the files from the zip into your game, at the `.exe` level.
5. Run the game (the first launch might take a while)

Not working? You might want to install the dependency [vc_redist](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe)

![Install](https://i.imgur.com/pvBAyZN.png)

**Linux Manual**
1. Install Among Us via Steam
2. Download newest [release](https://github.com/Eisbison/TheOtherRoles/releases/latest) and extract it to ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Among Us
3. Enable `winhttp.dll` via the proton winecfg (https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/advanced/steam_interop.html#open-winecfg-for-the-target-game)
4. Launch the game via Steam

# Custom Servers and 10+ Players
We always recommend you to play on custom servers rather than on the official ones. If you want to play with more than 10 players in one lobby, you're required to use a custom server. Credits for the original implementation that allowed 10+ player lobbies go to the creators of the [CrowdedMod](https://github.com/CrowdedMods/CrowdedMod).

**Setup the Clients:**
1. Open the region menu where you can choose between the different regions
2. Select the region *Custom*
3. Enter the ip/domain and the port of your custom server in the corresponding text fields

**Setup the Server:**
1. Get the [Impostor](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor) release for the Among Us version **2021.3.31 - 2021.4.2**
2. Follow the steps (using the server release you just downloaded) on the official [Impostor-Documentation](https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor/wiki/Running-the-server)
3. Make sure to set the following values to false in the `config.json` file:
```
    ...
    "AntiCheat": {
      "Enabled": false,
      "BanIpFromGame": false
    }
```
4. Make sure to forward the right ports on the hosting machine
5. Run the server and setup the client

**Setting up Server as Docker Container:** \
If you want to run the server as a docker container you'll need to use the image
```
aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```
(Currently only the "nightly" tag is starting a server supporting 2021.3.31 or later)

In addition to running it, the environment variables to disable the AntiCheat feature need to be set.
```
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false
IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false
```

Example to docker run command:
```
docker run -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

Or use to run it in the background
```
docker run -d -p 22023:22023/udp --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__Enabled=false --env IMPOSTOR_AntiCheat__BanIpFromGame=false aeonlucid/impostor:nightly
```

# Settings
The mod adds a few new settings to Among Us (in addition to the role settings):
- **Streamer Mode:** You can activate the streamer mode in the Among Us settings. It hides the lobby code, the custom server ip and the custom server port. You can set a custom lobby code replacement text, by changing the *Streamer Mode Replacement Text* in the `BepInEx\config\me.eisbison.theotherroles.cfg` file.
- **Number of Crewmates:** The number of Crewmate roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Neutrals:** The number of Neutral roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Impostors:** The number of Impostor roles can be set inside a lobby.
- **Number of Modifiers:** The number of Modifiers can be set inside a lobby.
- **Map:** The map can be changed inside a lobby.
- **Maximum Number Of Meetings:** You can set the maximum number of meetings that can be called in total (Every player still has personal maximum of buttons, but if the maximum number of meetings is reached you can't use your meetings even if you have some left. Impostor and Jackal meetings also count).
- **Allow Skips On Emergency Meetings:** If set to false, there will not be a skip button in emergency meetings. If a player does not vote, they'll vote themself.
- **Hide Player Names:** Hides the names of all players that have role which is unknown to you. Team Lovers/Impostors/Jackal still see the names of their teammates. Impostors can also see the name of the Spy and everyone can still see the age of the mini.
- **Allow Parallel MedBay Scans:** Allows players to perform their MedBay scans at the same time.
- **Shield Last Game First Kill** The first killed player of the previous round will be shielded for all players visible until the first meeting.
- **Play On A Random Map** If enabled it allows you to set a rotation of all current maps, except ehT dlekS 
- **Ghosts Can See Roles**
- **Ghosts Can See Votes**
- **Ghosts Can Additionally See Modifier**
- **Ghosts Can See The Number Of Remaining Tasks**
- **The map is accessable during a meeting and will show your last location when a body gets reported/meeting gets called**
- **When you're a ghost and done with tasks, you'll get a zoom out/overview function**
- **Task Counts:** You are now able to select more tasks.
- **Role Summary:** When a game ends there will be a list of all players and their roles and their task progress
- **Darker/Lighter:** Displays color type of each player in meetings

### Task Count Limits per map
You can configure:
- Up to 4 common tasks
- Up to 23 short tasks
- Up to 15 long tasks

Please note, that if the configured option exceeds the available number of tasks of a map, the tasks will be limited to that number of tasks. \
Example: If you configure 4 common tasks on Airship crewmates will only receive 2 common tasks, as airship doesn't offer more than 2 common tasks.

| Map | Common Tasks | Short Tasks | Long Tasks |
|----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Skeld / Dleks | 2 | 19 | 8
| Mira HQ | 2 | 13 | 11
| Polus | 4 | 14 | 15
| Airship | 2 | 23 | 15

# Custom Hats
## Create and submit new hat designs
We're awaiting your creative hat designs and we'll integrate all the good ones in our mod.
Here are a few instructions, on how to create a custom hat:

- **Creation:** A hat consists of up to three textures. The aspect ratio of the textures has to be `4:5`, we recommend `300px:375px`:
  - `Main texture (required)`:
    - This is the main texture of your hat. It will usually be rendered in front of the player, if you set the `behind` parameter it will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern *hatname.png*, but you can also set some additional parameters in the file name by adding `_parametername` to the file name (before the *.png*).
    - Parameter `bounce`: This parameter determines whether the hat will bounce while you're walking or not.
    - Parameter `adaptive`: If this parameter is set, the Among Us coloring shader will be applied (the shader that replaces some colors with the colors that your character is wearing in the game). The color red (#ff0000) will be replaced with the primary color of your player and the color blue (#0000ff) with the secondary color. Also other colors will be affected and changed, you can have a look at the texture of the [Crewmate Hat](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/among-us-wiki/images/e/e0/Crewmate_hat.png) to see how this feature should be used.
    - Parameter `behind`: If this parameter is set, the main texture will be rendered behind the player.
  - `Flipped texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Main texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_flip.png`.
  - `Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered behind the player.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back.png`.
  - `Flipped Back texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered instead of the Back texture, when facing the left.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_back_flip.png`.
  - `Climb texture (optional)`:
    - This texture will be rendered in front of the player, when they're climbing.
    - The name of the texture needs to follow the pattern `hatname_climb.png`.
- **Testing:** You can test your hat design by putting all the files in the `\TheOtherHats\Test` subfolder of your mod folder. Then whenever you start a Freeplay game, you and all the dummies will be wearing the new hat. You don't need to restart Among Us if you change the hat files, just exit and reenter the Freeplay mode.

- **Submission:** If you got a hat design, you can submit it on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/77RkMJHWsM). We'll look at all the hats and add all the good ones to the game.

# Colors
![TOR_colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113001912/190032746-06cccc0d-13a5-4bb4-b506-89ae91464d6b.jpg)

# Roles

## Role Assignment

First you need to choose how many special roles of each kind (Impostor/Neutral/Crewmate) you want in the game.
The count you set will only be reached, if there are enough Crewmates/Impostors in the game and if enough roles are set to be in the game (i.e. they are set to > 0%). The roles are then being distributed as follows:
- First all roles that are set to 100% are being assigned to arbitrary players.
- After that each role that has 10%-90% selected adds 1-9 tickets to a ticket pool (there exists a ticket pool for Crewmates, Neutrals and Impostors). Then the roles will be selected randomly from the pools as long it's possible (until the selected number is reached, until there are no more Crewmates/Impostors or until there are no more tickets). If a role is selected from the pool, obviously all the tickets of that role are being removed.
- The Mafia, Lovers and Mini are being selected independently (without using the ticket system) according to the spawn chance you selected. After that the Crewmate, Neutral and Impostor roles are selected and assigned in a random order.

**Example:**\
Settings: 2 special Crewmate roles, Snitch: 100%, Hacker: 10%, Tracker: 30%\
Result: Snitch is assigned, then one role out of the pool [Hacker, Tracker, Tracker, Tracker] is being selected\
Note: Changing the settings to Hacker: 20%, Tracker: 60% would statistically result in the same outcome .


## Mafia
### **Team: Impostors**
The Mafia are a group of three Impostors.\
The Godfather works like a normal Impostor.\
The Mafioso is an Impostor who cannot kill until the Godfather is dead.\
The Janitor is an Impostor who cannot kill, but they can hide dead bodies instead.\
\
**NOTE:**
- There have to be 3 Impostors activated for the mafia to spawn.

### Game Options

## Morphling

\
**NOTE:**
- They shrink to the size of the Mini when they copy its look.
- The Hacker sees the new color on the admin table.
- The color of the footprints changes accordingly (also the ones that were already on the ground).
- The other Impostor still sees that they are an Impostor (the name remains red).
- The shield indicator changes accordingly (the Morphling gains or loses the shield indicator).
- Tracker and Snitch arrows keep working.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Morphling Spawn Chance | -
| Morphling Cooldown | -
| Morph Duration | Time the Morphling stays morphed
-----------------------

## Camouflager
### **Team: Impostors**
The Camouflager is an Impostor which can additionally activate a camouflage mode.\
The camouflage mode lasts for 10s and while it is active, all player names/pets/hats\
are hidden and all players have the same color.\

## Vampire
### **Team: Impostors**
The Vampire is an Impostor, that can bite other player. Bitten players die after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Vampire spawn chance is greater 0 (even if there is no Vampire in the game), all players can place one garlic.\
If a victim is near a garlic, the "Bite Button" turns into the default "Kill Button" and the Vampire can only perform a normal kill.\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a bitten player is still alive when a meeting is being called, they die at the start of the meeting.
- The cooldown is the same as the default kill cooldown (+ the kill delay if the Vampire bites the target).
- If there is a Vampire in the game, there can't be a Warlock.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Vampire Spawn Chance | -
| Vampire Kill Delay | -
| Vampire Cooldown | Sets the kill/bite cooldown
| Vampire Can Kill Near Garlics | The Vampire can never bite when their victim is near a garlic. If this option is set to true, they can still perform a normal kill there.
-----------------------

## Eraser
### **Team: Impostors**
The Eraser is an Impostor that can erase the role of every player.\
The targeted players will lose their role after the meeting right before a player is exiled.\
After every erase, the cooldown increases by 10 seconds.\
The erase will be performed, even if the Eraser or their target die before the next meeting.\
By default the Eraser can erase everyone but the Spy and other Impostors.\
Depending on the options they can also erase them (Impostors will lose their special Impostor ability).\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Shifter shift will always be triggered before the Erase (hence either the new role of the Shifter will be erased or the Shifter saves the role of their target, depending on whom the Eraser erased)
- Erasing a Lover automatically erases the other Lover as well (if the second Lover is an ImpLover, they will turn into an Impostor)
- Erasing a Jackal that has a Sidekick, triggers the Sidekick promotion if it's activated in the settings
- As the erase is being triggered before the ejection of a player, erasing and voting out a Lover in the same round, would result in the
ex-Lover surviving, as the partnership was erased before. Also a Jester win would not happen, as the erase will be triggered before.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Eraser Spawn Chance | -
| Eraser Cooldown | The Eraser's cooldown will increase by 10 seconds after every erase.
| Eraser Can Erase Anyone | If set to false, they can't erase the Spy and other Impostors

If the Trickster has placed all of their boxes they will be converted into a vent network usable only by the Trickster themself, but the boxes are revealed to the others.\
If the boxes are converted to a vent network, the Trickster gains a new ability "Lights out" to limit the visibility of Non-Impostors, that cannot be fixed by other players. Lights are automatically restored after a while.\
\
**NOTE:**
- Impostors will get a text indicator at the bottom of the screen to notify them if the lights are out due to the Trickster ability, as there is no sabotage arrows or task to sabotage text to otherwise notify them about it.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Trickster Spawn Chance | -
| Trickster Box Cooldown | Cooldown for placing jack-in-the-boxes

- If there is a Cleaner in the game, there can't be a Vulture.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Cleaner Spawn Chance | -
| Cleaner Cooldown | Cooldown for cleaning dead bodies
-----------------------

## Warlock
### **Team: Impostors**

If the cursed person stands next to another player, the Warlock is able to kill that player (no matter how far away they are).\
Performing a kill with the help of a cursed player, will lift the curse and it will result in the Warlock being unable to move for a configurable amount of time.\
The Warlock can still perform normal kills, but the two buttons share the same cooldown.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Warlock can always kill their Impostor mates (and even themself) using the "cursed kill"

## Bounty Hunter
### **Team: Impostors**

The Bounty Hunter is an Impostor, that continuously get bounties (the targeted player doesn't get notified).\
The target of the Bounty Hunter swaps after every meeting and after a configurable amount of time.\
If the Bounty Hunter kills their target, their kill cooldown will be a lot less than usual.\
Killing a player that's not their current target results in an increased kill cooldown.\
Depending on the options, there'll be an arrow pointing towards the current target.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The target won't be an Impostor, a Spy or the Bounty Hunter's Lover.
- Killing the target resets the timer and a new target will be selected.

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|

## Witch
### **Team: Impostors**
The Witch is an Impostor who has the ability to cast a spell on other players.\
During the next meeting, the spellbound player will be highlighted and they'll die right after the meeting.\
There are multiple options listed down below with which you can configure to fit your taste.\
Similar to the Vampire, shields and blanks will be checked twice (at the end of casting the spell on the player and at the end of the meeting, when the spell will be activated).\
This can result in players being marked as spelled during the meeting, but not dying in the end (when they get a shield or the Witch gets blanked after they were spelled by the Witch).\
If the Witch dies before the meeting starts or if the Witch is being guessed during the meeting, the spellbound players will be highlighted but they'll survive in any case.\
Depending on the options you can choose whether voting the Witch out will save all the spellbound players or not.\
\
**NOTE:**
- The spellbound players will die before the voted player dies (which might trigger e.g. trigger an Impostor win condition, even if the Witch is the one being voted)

### Game Options
| Name | Description |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Witch Spawn Chance | -
| Witch Spell Casting Cooldown | -

-----------------------

## Ninja
### **Team: Impostors**
The Ninja is an Impostor who has the ability to kill another player all over the map.\
You can mark a player with your ability and by using the ability again, you jump to the position of the marked player and kill it.\
Depending on the options you know where your marked player is.\
If the Ninja uses its ability, it will leave a trace (leaves) for a configurable amount of time where it activated the ability and additionally where it killed the before marked player.\
When performing a ninja ability kill, the ninja can be invisible for some seconds (depends on options)\
\
**NOTE:**
- The Ninja has a 5 second cooldown after marking a player
- The trace has a darker (black) or lighter (white) color depending on the players color that will fade into green
- The mark on the marked player will reset after a meeting or after using the ability to kill the marked player. Performing a normal kill will **NOT** reset the mark
- If the Ninja tries to kill a shielded player (e.g. Medic shield, Shield last game first kill ), the kill will not be performed
- If the Ninja tries to kill the Time Master while the shield is active, the Ninja won't teleport to the players position, but the Time Master shield will still be activated
- If the marked target is on a different floor on Submerged, the arrow will always point to the elevator

You can select how many players can be shot per game and if multiple players can be shot during a single meeting.\
The guesses Impostor and Crewmate are only right, if the player is part of the corresponding team and has no special role.\
You can only shoot during the voting time.\
Depending on the options, the Guesser can't guess the shielded player and depending on the Medic options the Medic/shielded player might be notified (no one will die, independently of what the Guesser guessed).\
\
**NOTE:**
- If a player gets shot, you'll get back your votes

## Jackal
### **Team: Jackal**
The Jackal is part of an extra team, that tries to eliminate all the other players.\
The Jackal has no tasks and can kill Impostors, Crewmates and Neutrals.\
The Jackal (if allowed by the options) can select another player to be their Sidekick.
Creating a Sidekick removes all tasks of the Sidekick and adds them to the team Jackal. The Sidekick loses their current role (except if they're a Lover, then they play in two teams).
The "Create Sidekick Action" may only be used once per Jackal or once per game (depending on the options).
The Jackal can also promote Impostors to be their Sidekick, but depending on the options the Impostor will either really turn into the Sidekick and leave the team Impostors or they will just look like the Sidekick to the Jackal and remain as they were.\
Also if a Spy or Impostor gets sidekicked, they still will appear red to the Impostors.

The team Jackal enables multiple new outcomes of the game, listing some examples here:
- The Impostors could be eliminated and then the crew plays against the team Jackal.
- The Crew could be eliminated, then the Team Jackal fight against the Impostors (The Crew can still make a task win in this scenario)

The priority of the win conditions is the following:
1. Crewmate Mini lose by vote
2. Jester wins by vote
3. Arsonist win
4. Team Impostor wins by sabotage
5. Team Crew wins by tasks (also possible if the whole Crew is dead)
6. Lovers among the last three players win
7. Team Jackal wins by outnumbering (When the team Jackal contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 Impostors left and team Jackal contains no Lover)
8. Team Impostor wins by outnumbering (When the team Impostors contains an equal or greater amount of players than the Crew and there are 0 players of the team Jackal left and team Impostors contains no Lover)
9. Team Crew wins by outnumbering (When there is no player of the team Jackal and the team Impostors left)

**NOTE:**
- The Jackal (and their Sidekick) may be killed by a Sheriff.
- A Jackal cannot target the Mini, while it's growing up. After that they can kill it or select it as its Sidekick.
- The Crew can still win, even if all of their members are dead, if they finish their tasks fast enough (That's why converting the last Crewmate with tasks left into a Sidekick results in a task win for the crew.)

If both Impostors and Jackals are in the game, the game continues even if all Crewmates are dead. Crewmates may still win in this case by completing their tasks. Jackal and Impostor have to kill each other.
